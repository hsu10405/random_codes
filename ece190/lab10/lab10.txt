1. For Problem 2 on the wiki, list the times each 
of the test cases took.

a. Search key = 2       Time taken: 1.50204e-05

b. Search key = 9998    Time taken: 2.88486e-05

c. Search key = 4877    Time taken: 1.28746e-05

d. Search key = 12876   Time taken: 4.91142e-05

2. For Problem 3 on the wiki, list the times each 
of the test cases took.

a. Search key = 2       Time taken: 9.53674e-07

b. Search key = 9998    Time taken: 9.53674e-07

c. Search key = 4877    Time taken: 9.53674e-07

d. Search key = 12876   Time taken: 0

3. For each of the above cases explain why you see 
the difference in the timings.

a. Search key = 2       

b. Search key = 9998     

c. Search key = 4877     

d. Search key = 12876  

In sequential search the list is always searched from the beginning of the
list. so numbers at the end of the list takes more time to be found. In binary
search however, the list is divided into two equal section since the list is
sorted. Then the program only have to look at half of the whole list which
uses fewer cycles for computation.
