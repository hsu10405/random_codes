Testing MP4.2
=============
Included are a few test cases and a gold executable to check your code.
mp4.1gold will produce the correct output image given the specified input image.
Your code must produce the same output image as mp4.1gold given the same input image (your results may differ within a specified range).

To use the gold code or imgdiff executables, you must first change the permissions on them.
To do so, use this command:
  chmod 700 mp4.2gold imgdiff

The syntax for the gold executable is:
  ./mp4.2gold IMAGE_FILE
Notes:
  The horizonal edge filtered image output will be named "h_edge.ppm"
  The vertical edge filtered image output will be named "v_edge.ppm"
  The size and center of the square will be displayed to the console by our main function.

To compare your filter results with the gold code results, use the following command:
  ./imgdiff GOLD_FILTER_IMG OUTPUT_FILTER_IMG
imgdiff will read in the two images and compare the values in each array. If they are not completely equal, it will print an error message and return -1.
You may use vimdiff to compare the files, but note that your file formatting will have to match that of the input file or vimdiff will not be as useful.
imgdiff works regardless of file whitespace formatting.

Your output needs to match ours within the ranges specified on the MP4 wiki.
The provided tests are not guaranteed to cover all possibilities. 
You should think of your own test cases in addition to these.
