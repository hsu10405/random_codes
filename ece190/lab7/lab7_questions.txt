Answer the following questions

1)There is a major fault with the following code. It is more intuitive to answer it without assembling it.

    .ORIG x3000
    LEA R3, BINARY      
    LD  R6, ASCII       ;character
    LD  R7, COUNT       ;initialize count to 10
REPEAT      TRAP x23    ;get character
    ADD R0,R0,R6        ;convert to a number
    STR R0,R3,#0        ;store number
    ADD R3,R3,#1        ;pointer is incremented
    ADD R7,R7,-1        ;counter is decremented
    BRp REPEAT      ;carry on
    BRnzp   NEXT
ASCII       .FILL   xFFD0
COUNT       .FILL   #10
BINARY      .BLKW   #10

    .END

The program doesn't halt, there is no TRAP x25 to stop the machine. Also, the
label NEXT is no defined in the code.

2) Explain the difference between JSR and the JSRR instructions.
JSR jumps to subroutine base on the PC and offset. JSRR takes the value of a
register as an memory address and an offset and jump to that subroutine.
