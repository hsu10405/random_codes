Testing MP4.1
=============
Included are a few test cases and a gold executable to check your code.
mp4.1gold will produce the correct output image given the specified input image and filter.
Your code must produce the exact same output image as mp4.1gold given the same input image and filter.

To use the gold code or imgdiff executables, you must first change the permissions on them.
To do so, use this command:
  chmod 777 mp4.1gold imgdiff

The syntax for the gold executable is:
  ./mp4.1gold IMAGE_FILE [FILTER_FILE]
Notes:
  FILTER_FILE is optional, and if not specified will default to "filter.txt"
  The resulting image will be stored in the filename specified in the provided main function ("output.ppm")

To compare your results with the output of the gold executable, use the following command:
  ./imgdiff GOLD_OUTPUT_IMG YOUR_OUTPUT_IMG
imgdiff will read in the two images and compare the values in each array. If they are not completel equal, it will print an error message and return -1.
You may use vimdiff to compare the files, but note that your file formatting will have to match that of the input file or vimdiff will not be as useful.
imgdiff works regardless of file whitespace formatting.

Your output needs to match ours exactly.
These tests are not guaranteed to cover all possibilities.
You should try to think of your own test cases in addition to these.
