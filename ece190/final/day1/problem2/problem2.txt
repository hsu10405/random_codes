Problem 2 Answers
=================

Part A) Consider the 32-bit instruction as shown. What is the minimum number of
bits required to represent the OPCODE?

Minimum number of bits:
10 bits, 2^10 = 1024, 2^9 = 512. 1024>640>512

Part B) Consider the 32-bit instruction as shown. What is the maximum possible 
number of registers? Show your work.
Source 1, source 2, dest must share the same amount of bit.
so 32 - 10 (opcodes ) = 22 bits left
22 / 3 = 7 remain 1.
so 2^7 = 128 registers 




Maximum possible number of registers: 128 registers
